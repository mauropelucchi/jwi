jwi - Java Wordnet Interface
============================

(Mavenized version of) JWI 2.3.3 - this git repo is intended to shadow 
the latest source version from http://projects.csail.mit.edu/jwi/, but
augment the code with a maven *pom.xml* file with http://repo.delver.io
as the initial repository.

**Note:** No additional functionality (beyond mavenization) will _ever_ be added.
